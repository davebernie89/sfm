Description: R package sfm makes the estimation of cross-sectional and panel stochastic frontier models user friendly. This package is currently being developed to work in a wide range of applications. The main functions of the package are two cross-sectional functions: "sfm" and "zsfm" as well as a panel function "psfm" which all implement various SFA based estimators.
